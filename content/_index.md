                  <ul>
                    <li>Designed and developed highly scalable claims KPI data pipelines, leveraging technologies such as RDBMS, Big Data, and Cloud, to streamline the collection, storage, modeling, and analysis of massive datasets from heterogeneous systems.</li>
                    <li>Automated data import and export processes from MySQL to HDFS using Sqoop jobs, significantly reducing manual effort.</li>
                    <li>Engineered real-time distributed ETL data pipelines to optimize claim data processing, resulting in a 50% reduction in processing time. Technologies utilized include Hadoop, Hive, PySpark, Kafka, and Airflow.</li>
                    <li>Developed an efficient injection pipeline to transfer data from HDFS to Snowflake, which dramatically improved dashboard response times for claims KPI application from 45 seconds to approximately 15 seconds.</li>
